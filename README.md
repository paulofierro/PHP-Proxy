PHP-Proxy
=========

A simple PHP proxy to load XML from third-party servers. Useful for loading in XML via JavaScript (originally written for using it with Flash).

I wrote this years ago and lost it and then came across it in use in a few places on Google. So I decided to move it here so I won't lose it again :)
